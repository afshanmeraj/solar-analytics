# Notes before reviewing the code:

- App is built on angular, with some angular material designs
- I tried to implement as much functionality as I could, functionality wise everything is working fine.
- There is some room for improvement in UI, I didnt follow the exact dimension given in the images, tried to add the basic look and positioning.
- I have added the themes change functionality too, but there is no switcher(for now), so you have to do it from code (app.component.ts)

# Area of improvements
- Unit tests, I didnt have much time to integrate testing but thats the thing which i would've added if I had enough time.
- UI could've been better, I am not really awesome in writing exact css, but I tried my best. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
